# GitHub Student Pack Issue (SOLVED)

Most student discounts are made by brands these days.<br> Like Google , Try Hackme , JetBrains ...<br> 
One of them is GitHub. 
I was trying to get this discount like every student in recent days. But I got denied too much. I didn't understand why and I've decided to send a ticket to GitHub Support. They responed to me. They said 

```mail
    
I have manually reviewed your most recent application and I can advise the following specific adjustments in order to help your application when you reapply:
 
1. Please secure your GitHub account with two-factor authentication.
 
2. Please complete your GitHub billing information with your full name exactly as it appears in your academic affiliation document. You do not have to add a payment method. Please log out and log back in to GitHub before reapplying.
```

***I think most of us did ignore that, I can clearly understand when I google it.***
